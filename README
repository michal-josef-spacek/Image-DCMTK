NAME
    Image::DCMTK - Interface to the DCMTK Dicom Toolkit

VERSION
    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
    Provides a set of interface functions to the Dicom Toolkit (dcmtk)

    In most cases, the Dicom tags are treated as a hash to and from the
    various functions.

    There is an included Dicom Dictionary, but you are free to add your own
    tags as well

EXPORT
SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  openDicomFile

  returnTagAsXML
    Return an XML formatted string version of a given DICOM tag

    You may use either a Group and Element type tag or a DICOM Dictionary
